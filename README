Cattle -- Flexible Brainfuck interpreter library
================================================

Cattle is a flexible Brainfuck interpreter, implemented as a GObject-based
shared library. The Beef interpreter - from which Cattle was derived - itself
is supposed to be ported to this library once it gets mature enough.


Improved features
=================

The code loader used in Cattle has better error checking than the one used
in the standalone interpreter, and is able of catching common coding error
like unbalanced brackets.

The library supports flexible I/O using signals and callbacks, which means
you can do weird things like use the content of a GTK+ text widget as input
for a program and send its output to a network socket, if you want to do so.


Development status
==================

The library currently provides enough features to implement a complete
interpreter in about 50 lines of code (see examples/interpreter.c).

However, it doesn't perform nearly as good as Beef: any program takes many
times the time it would take on the standalone interpreter to run. Several
optimizations are already in place, and the performance loss has decreased
significantly since the first release.

There is no API or ABI stability guarantee at this point of time. Everything
is still subject sudden and thorough changes.
