Overview of changes from Cattle 0.9.1 to 0.9.2
==============================================

    * CattleTape: implemented bookmarks.

    * CattleInterpreter: added the "debug-request" signal, which behaves like
                         the existing I/O signals, and obsoletes the
                         CattleTape.dump() method.

    * Cache the object's private structure, to avoid looking it up for every
      single method call.

    * Various bug fixes.

    * CattleInterpreter: support flexible I/O using signals and callbacks.

    * Make all the structures completely opaque.
