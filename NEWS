Overview of changes from Cattle 0.9.3 to 0.9.4
==============================================

    * CattleTape: add fast bulk increase/decrease/move operations.

    * CattleInterpreter: use bulk operation for speed increase.


Overview of changes from Cattle 0.9.2 to 0.9.3
==============================================

    * CattleInterpreter:

        - provide a default implementations for all the I/O operations;
        - invoke only one handler on I/O signal emission;
        - remove the signal prototypes from the class structure;
        - add an error domain for runtime errors.

    * CattleProgram: use a single error code for both unmatched and
                     unbalanced brackets.

    * The caller owns the object returned by a method call, and must
      unreference it when finished to avoid memory leaks.

    * Enforce single header includes.

    * Expand the test suite and use the GTest framework.

    * Various bug fixes.


Overview of changes from Cattle 0.9.1 to 0.9.2
==============================================

    * CattleTape: implement bookmarks.

    * CattleInterpreter: add the "debug-request" signal, which behaves like
                         the existing I/O signals, and obsoletes the
                         CattleTape.dump() method.

    * Cache the object's private structure, to avoid looking it up for every
      single method call.

    * Various bug fixes.


Overview of changes from Cattle 0.9.0 to 0.9.1
==============================================

    * CattleTape: use memory chunks instead of allocating each cell
                  separately, reducing memory usage and improving
                  performances.

    * CattleInterpreter: support flexible I/O using signals and callbacks.

    * Make all the structures completely opaque.

    * Some bug fixes.
