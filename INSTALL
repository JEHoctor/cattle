Prerequisites
=============

Cattle depends on the following libraries and programs:

    * The GLib library and its GObject module, with a minimum version
      of 2.16.0

    * The pkg-config script

    * Optionally, the Gtk-Doc tools, if you wish to rebuild the API reference
      yourself (a pre-built copy is shipped along with the sources)


Installation
============

The Cattle library is simply not ready for production use: this release is
intended only as a technology preview, targeted at developers and other
interested individuals.

Installing Cattle is discouraged; as a matter of fact, it is not even possible
without tweaking the build scripts.

Since I'm not going to bump the soname until the first stable release,
installing Cattle and linking anything to the installed copy is asking for
breakage. Just don't do it.
