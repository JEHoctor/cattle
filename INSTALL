Prerequisites
=============

Cattle depends on the following libraries and programs:

  * The GLib library and its GObject module, with a minimum version
    of 2.16.0

  * GObject Introspection, to build introspection data

  * The pkg-config script

  * Optionally, the GTK-Doc tools, if you wish to rebuild the API
    reference yourself (a pre-built copy is shipped along with the
    sources)


Installation
============

The Cattle library is not ready for production use: this release is
intended only as a technology preview, targeted at developers and other
interested individuals.

Installing Cattle is discouraged; as a matter of fact, it is not even
possible without tweaking the build scripts.

Since the soname is not going to be bumped until the first stable release,
despite the changes, installing Cattle and linking anything to the
installed copy is asking for breakage. Just don't do it.
