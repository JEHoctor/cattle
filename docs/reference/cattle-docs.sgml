        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>
            Cattle is a library implementing a flexible interpreter for the
            Brainfuck programming language.
        </para>
        <para>
            The library allows one to easily embed a full-featured and quite
            performing Brainfuck interpreter into any application; to further
            improve integration, all I/O operations can be performed using
            custom routines.
        </para>
        <para>
            Great care has been taken in order to make the API simple and
            conforming to expectation: any programmer with previous exposure
            to the GNOME stack should be able to feel right at home.
        </para>
        <para>
            The library is still under development, and some planned features
            are not yet implemented, or only halfway to completion.
        </para>
