<para>
	Cattle is a library implementing a flexible interpreter for the
	Brainfuck programming language.
</para>
<para>
	The library allows one to easily embed a full-featured Brainfuck
	interpreter into any application; to make the interaction between
	the hosting application and the Brainfuck interpreter completely
	transparent, Cattle can be configured to use a custom set of I/O
	routines instead of the standard ones.
</para>
<para>
	The behaviour of the interpreter itself is highly configurable,
	as to fit most needs.
</para>
<para>
	The library is still under development, and some planned features
	are only partially implemented, or not implemented at all.
