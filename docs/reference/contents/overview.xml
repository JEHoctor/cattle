	<para>
		Cattle is a library implementing a flexible interpreter for the
		Brainfuck programming language.
	</para>

	<para>
		The library allows one to easily embed a full-featured Brainfuck
		interpreter into any application; to make the interaction between
		the hosting application and the Brainfuck interpreter completely
		transparent, Cattle can be configured to use a custom set of I/O
		routines instead of the standard ones.
	</para>

	<para>
		The behaviour of the interpreter itself is highly configurable,
		as to fit most needs.
	</para>

	<para>
		The library is still under development, and some planned features
		are only partially implemented, or not implemented at all.
	</para>
